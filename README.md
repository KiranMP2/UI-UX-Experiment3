# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the user experience (UX) of three leading ride-hailing applications—Ola, Uber, and Rapido—using Jakob Nielsen’s heuristic principles. The objective is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare competing platforms, and recommend improvements that enhance overall usability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

## Algorithm:

### Step 1: Selection of Apps

Choose the competing applications for evaluation:

Ola

Uber

Rapido

### Step 2: Define Framework

Use Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the evaluation criteria.

### Step 3: Data Collection

Perform hands-on testing of each app.
Execute common tasks such as:

Booking rides (cabs, bikes)

Tracking live rides

Applying promo codes and offers

Choosing ride types (micro, mini, sedan, bike)

Contacting support
Record observations for each heuristic.

### Step 4: Heuristic Evaluation

Evaluate each app against the 10 heuristics.
Note usability strengths, weaknesses, and heuristic violations.

### Step 5: Comparative Analysis

Create a comparison table to analyze how each app performs.
Highlight the best performer per heuristic.

### Step 6: Problem Identification

List recurring usability issues.
Prioritize critical problems affecting user experience.

### Step 7: Recommendations

Suggest actionable design or feature improvements for each app.
Align recommendations with UX best practices.

### Step 8: Conclusion

Summarize the overall evaluation.
Identify which app delivers the strongest UX and provide improvement paths for the others.

## Output:
Heuristic Evaluation of Ride-Hailing Apps: Ola, Uber, and Rapido
Introduction

This report presents a heuristic evaluation of three leading ride-hailing platforms: Ola, Uber, and Rapido. The evaluation is based on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, focusing on user experience (UX), interface design, and feature efficiency. The goal is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare competing platforms, and suggest improvements to enhance customer satisfaction.

Evaluation Framework

We used Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the framework:

Visibility of system status

Match between system and real world

User control and freedom

Consistency and standards

Error prevention

Recognition rather than recall

Flexibility and efficiency of use

Aesthetic and minimalist design

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Help and documentation
The Heuristic Evaluation of Zomato and Swiggy is created and verified.

### Key Findings

Ola: Strength in variety of vehicle options and wallet integration. Weakness in occasional UI clutter and slower support.

Uber: Strength in consistency, personalization, and fast support. Weakness in higher fares sometimes.

Rapido: Strength in bike rides, fast booking, and lightweight app. Weakness in limited features and support.

Recommendations

#### For Ola:

Simplify home screen and booking interface.

Improve live support response times.

Enhance error prevention for payment and address issues.

#### For Uber:

Introduce better cost-saving suggestions and promo integrations.

Include more localized ride options like micro or bike rides in some cities.

#### For Rapido:

Add support for cab/other vehicle options.

Improve help & documentation.

Enhance personalization features for repeat users.

| Category                    | Best Performer |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Personalization & Discovery | Zomato         |
| Aesthetics & Minimalism     | Swiggy         |
| Speed & Efficiency          | Swiggy         |
| Dining Integration          | Zomato         |
| Support & Error Recovery    | Swiggy         |
| Promotions & Offers         | Zomato         |
```
### Conclusion

Ola, Uber, and Rapido each excel in different aspects of UX. Ola dominates in variety of vehicles and wallet integration, providing flexibility in ride choice. Uber stands out for speed, consistent design, personalization, and superior customer support. Rapido excels in fast, efficient bike rides and lightweight usability. Targeted improvements—like enhancing Rapido’s features, Ola simplifying UI, and Uber adding more local ride options—can make all three platforms more user-friendly and efficient.

## Result

The Heuristic Evaluation of Ola, Uber, and Rapido is created and verified.
